		Important Notes:
		
		1. Items use the labelField property to set the text that appears on the
		item renderers. In this case, we want the label attribute from the XML.
		
		2. The TreeMap determines the dimensions of each item renderer using the
		weightField property. We'll use the data attribute from the XML.
